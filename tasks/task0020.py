"""
Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

Example 1:
    Input: s = "leetcode"
    Output: 0

Example 2:
    Input: s = "loveleetcode"
    Output: 2

Example 3:
    Input: s = "aabb"
    Output: -1

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s consists of only lowercase English letters.
